RI-measurement-operator
=======================

``RI-measurement-operator`` is a radio-interferometry MATLAB library devoted to
the implementation of the measurement operator. The proposed implementation can accommodate

- math:`w`-correction :cite:p:`Dabbech2018`;
- a compact Fourier model for the direction dependent effects (DDEs) :cite:p:`Dabbech2021`.

The ``RI-measurement-operator`` library is a core dependency of the `Faceted-Hyper-SARA <https://github.com/basp-group/Faceted-Hyper-SARA>`_ wideband imaging library for radio-interferometry.
